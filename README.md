# Prediction Wrapper

This is a set of utility classes that makes it much easier to run sklearn machine learning experiments. For demonstration purpose, this is a refined but also a tone-downed version of what I am current using at work. 

Check out the [run_example.ipynb] (https://github.com/beardeer/prediction-wrapper/blob/master/run_example.ipynb) to see an example of using this package to run 5-fold cross-validations on 3 different classification models with 3 performance metrics by only using a few lines of code.
