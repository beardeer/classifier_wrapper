# Prediction Wrapper

This is a set of utility classes that makes it much easier to run sklearn machine learning experiments. For demonstration purpose, this is a refined but also a tune-downed version of what I am current using at work. 

Checkout the run_example.ipynb to see an example of using this package to run 5-fold cross-validations on 3 different classification models with 3 performance metrics by only using a few lines of code.
